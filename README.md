# First-LR-Model
A simple Linear Regression Model, created, trained and tested on road accident scenarios.

In underdeveloped countries, there are a number of ways this model can help;
1) Boosting Local Data-Driven Decision Making
2) Targeted Awareness Campaigns
3) Prioritizing Infrastructure Improvements
4) Improved Traffic Regulations

It may not be much, but as long as information is power, such LR models can greatly help involved industries.
